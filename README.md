Since we didn't put any Summary or descriptions fot most our previous commit that we did on git hub and the only option we had is to show that we did this git commit fot that purpose is a adding a tag to our each commit that we have made a change so we added tags to our each commit that bwe have change our codes and error fixing stuff. So it's really easy if you going to our github uin web and navigar=te to tags and see what we did.

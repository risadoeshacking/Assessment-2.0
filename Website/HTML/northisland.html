          You’ll find the best of both worlds in Auckland, with beautiful rainforests, parks and beaches all so close to the city centre. The Waitākere Ranges Regional Park west of the city centre has more than 250 kilometres of walking and hiking tracks through lush native rainforest, past cascading waterfalls and along a magnificent coastline. Walk through the region’s largest native forest in the Hunua Ranges or explore the striking landscapes of some of Auckland’s 26 regional parks, such as Duder, Shakespear, Tapapakanga or Āwhitu. 
          <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          You’re never far from the sea in Auckland. Bring your board to one of the black-sand surf beaches on the wild west coast – Karekare, Piha, Te Henga (Bethells), Muriwai and more. Head north to the expansive golden sands and clear waters of Tāwharanui and Pakiri. Closer to the city centre, and just a 15-minute drive from downtown Auckland, visit Mission Bay, Kohimarama or St Heliers. Enjoy a stroll along the promenade, hire a kayak or stand up paddleboard, and refuel with some fresh fish and chips by the seaside.

          Taupō was created nearly two thousand years ago by a volcanic eruption so big it darkened the skies in Europe and China. Visit the Craters of the Moon and you'll see evidence of the lake's fiery birth in the geysers, steaming craters and boiling mud pools. At some of Taupō's beaches, swimmers and paddlers can enjoy warm, geothermal water currents. 

          <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Just north of Taupō you'll find New Zealand's most visited attraction, the magnificent Huka Falls, where more than 220,000 litres of water thunder over the cliff face every second.

          For those who love the night sky, Taupō offers an unparalleled stargazing experience. Many glamping sites(opens in new window) in the area provide the ideal setting for this, allowing you to relax under starlit skies, soak in outdoor baths, and enjoy the tranquility of nature. Whether you choose a high-end glamping site or a cosy, rustic option, stargazing in Taupō is an unforgettable experience.

          Taupō is a great lake for water-skiing, sailing and kayaking. The Māori rock carvings at Mine Bay, which can only be seen from the water, make for a great boat trip or kayaking excursion. The forests surrounding the lake offer hiking and mountain biking to suit all levels of experience.

          The picturesque river city of Whanganui has an interesting history. During the late 1800s the city was an important trading centre, with the Whanganui river serving as a key transportation route for goods and people. The city's rapid expansion during this period has left its mark on the city's architecture. Notable buildings include the Royal Whanganui Opera House and the Sarjeant Art Gallery Te Whare o Rehua(opens in new window).

          Art lovers will be pleased to learn that Whanganui has been named as New Zealand's only UNESCO City of Design, in recognition the city's contribution to art and creativity.
          
          For traditional galleries visit Whanganui Regional Museum(opens in new window), which houses an impressive collection of Lindauer portraits and Māori tāonga, providing a glimpse into the region's rich history. The Sarjeant Art Gallery Te Whare o Rehua gallery(opens in new window) has an extensive collection of New Zealand and international art.
          
          For something less conventional, visit New Zealand Glassworks--Te Whare Tūhua o Te Ao(opens in new window) (NZG), the national centre of art glass, or the Quartz Museum of studio ceramics(opens in new window), New Zealand's only dedicated museum for studio ceramics. The latter is home to New Zealand's largest collection of ceramics, featuring over 1000 works by prominent kiwi artists.

You’ll find the best of both worlds in Auckland, with beautiful rainforests, parks and beaches all so close to the city centre. The Waitākere Ranges Regional Park west of the city centre has more than 250 kilometres of walking and hiking tracks through lush native rainforest, past cascading waterfalls and along a magnificent coastline. Walk through the region’s largest native forest in the Hunua Ranges or explore the striking landscapes of some of Auckland’s 26 regional parks, such as Duder, Shakespear, Tapapakanga or Āwhitu.

You’re never far from the sea in Auckland. Bring your board to one of the black-sand surf beaches on the wild west coast – Karekare, Piha, Te Henga (Bethells), Muriwai and more.

Closer to the city centre, and just a 15-minute drive from downtown Auckland, visit Mission Bay, Kohimarama or St Heliers. Enjoy a stroll along the promenade, hire a kayak or stand up paddleboard, and refuel with some fresh fish and chips by the seaside.

<--Bottom Line-->

Nelson Tasman is renowned for its stunning natural landscapes, with diverse geography capturing everything from long golden beaches to untouched forests and rugged mountains.

Perhaps it’s the sun, perhaps it’s the location, but Nelson Tasman has long been a magnet for creative people. With one of the largest numbers of working artists and galleries in the country, you’ll find an array of craftspeople living in the region; traditional, contemporary and Māori. Visit their studios, explore the weekend craft markets, taste the delicious locally made artisan products and find something extraordinary to take home with you.

Walk the sun-drenched sands of Golden Bay or head inland to Tākaka and see the impossibly clear waters of New Zealand’s largest freshwater springs. Walk the three-to-five day Abel Tasman track or, for a different view, take a sea kayaking tour around the coast and see a seal colony and little blue penguins bobbing in the water. 

Taste your way around the region by bicycle on Tasman’s Great Taste Trail or get your daily dose of adrenaline with a visit to one of the region’s world-class mountain bike parks. Or just relax... Sit in the sun, sip a wine from one of the local vineyards, and dine on the famous Nelson Bay scallops.

Accommodation options in Nelson Tasman range from basic backpacker lodges to luxury spa retreats, and everything in between.

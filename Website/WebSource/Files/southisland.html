            Central Otago is a powerful landscape, sunny, dry and brown with weathered ancient mountains, alpine herb fields and fast flowing rivers. 
             <br>
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 1860s this was a place of gold; you can still pan for it amongst the miners' old trails, stone cottages and relics of mine machinery. But the gold today in Central Otago is wine. Pinot Noir, that most fickle of grape varieties, excels in these southernmost vineyards and most of the wineries offer tours and tastings.Many Central Otago visitors hire a motorhome or mountain bike to explore the region at their own pace. This way you can see some of the region’s more remote sites, taste the seasonal flavours and absorb the incredible scenery that you will often have all to yourself. The area is known for its cycle trails. The 150 km Otago Central Rail Trail follows the route of the old railway; cycle from station to station staying in places little touched by modern hustle and bustle. The Roxburgh Gorge Trail and Clutha Gold Trail also offer unique experiences deep in the heart of Central Otago. The newest Lake Dunstan Trail(opens in new window) between Cromwell and Clyde incorporates vineyards, spectacular views, impressive clip on boardwalks and bridges along the way.  If you're not up for cycling, you might like to go wildflower walking in Alexandra, wander through the Cromwell Historic Precinct, take a cruise on Lakes Dunstan and Roxburgh or go curling in Naseby.At night, Central Otago becomes one of New Zealand's premier stargazing destinations. With minimal light pollution and expansive, clear skies, it provides exceptional spots for viewing the Milky Way and distant galaxies. For a memorable stargazing experience, Naseby Night Sky Tours(opens in new window) offers you to explore the wonders of the night sky.  Accommodation in Central Otago ranges from the luxury lodges set in inspiring locations through to character B&Bs, historic backpackers, country pubs, motels and camping grounds. Wherever you stay you will be welcomed by the locals.

            The Marlborough region is about world-famous Sauvignon Blanc, delicious fresh seafood and diverse landscapes, from valleys of vines to sheltered waterways.

          <p>
            Marlborough is about world famous Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand’s largest winegrowing region, and the soils and enviable climate that create it. It’s about fresh seafood sought by the world’s finest chefs. It’s about diverse landscapes, from valleys of vines to sheltered waterways of the Marlborough Sounds.

            Join a guided tour or hire a bike, and choose from more than 30 cellar doors, tasting award winning wines along the way. Indulge in a leisurely lunch at a vineyard restaurant, and pair the wine with local produce to create the ultimate match made in Marlborough. 
            
            Drive 20 minutes to the Marlborough Sounds, where 1500km of winding coastline is home to secluded bays, historic sites, marine reserves and precious island sanctuaries, which foster kiwi and other native species. Cruise or kayak your way through the Sounds, home to dolphins, whales, seals and seabirds. Walk or cycle over bush clad ridgelines of the 70km Queen Charlotte Track starting at Ship Cove, Captain Cook’s favourite NZ landing site.
            
            Don’t miss a visit to the internationally acclaimed Omaka Aviation Heritage Centre, with its theatrical displays of WWI and WWII aircraft and memorabilia.
            
            At night, take a star gazing tour with Omaka Observatory, which offers bus pick-up from Blenheim railway station. Enjoy the night sky with minimal light pollution, guided by professionals, and experience the star clusters through telescopes. 
            
            Marlborough is one of New Zealand’s sunniest places, so why not choose to stay for a weekend or a week, summer through winter, in a vineyard villa or a hideaway on the water’s edge, and discover why Marlborough is Brilliant Every Day.

            Christchurch was founded by the Canterbury Association, which was formed in 1848 largely through the efforts of John Robert Godley and planned to establish a model Church of England settlement. The original immigrants arrived on five ships in 1850–51. Their settlement, known as Canterbury, was renamed for Christ Church, Oxford, the college Godley had attended. Proclaimed a city in 1862 and made a borough in 1868, Christchurch was expanded in 1903, and it is now the most populous city on South Island and the second largest city (after Auckland) in New Zealand.
             <br>
          </p>
          <p>
            Once dependent primarily on its rich agricultural environs, Christchurch expanded in the latter half of the 20th century to become New Zealand’s second most important industrial centre, aided by good transportation facilities, adequate supplies of artesian water, and plentiful, inexpensive hydroelectric power. To its traditional meat-freezing works and woolen and agricultural-implement production have been added the manufacture of clothing, carpets, rubber, wood and cork goods, transportation equipment, tires, soap, fertilizers, glass, footwear, and flour.
